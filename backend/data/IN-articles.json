Their content—posts, newsletters and videos—resonated with viewers. Fees soared, with top creators reportedly charging up to ₹22,00,000 ( ₹2.2 million) per reel. Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated virtual influencers (VIs) are helpful, but only with transparency and co-creation with human creators.",
